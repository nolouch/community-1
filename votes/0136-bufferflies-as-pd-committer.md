# A Vote for bufferflies as PD Committer

## Proposal

[@bufferflies](https://github.com/bufferflies) has been working on `tikv/pd` for more than four months. He has continuously contributed to the scheduler, recovery, and statistics for PD.

His main contribution is implementing simulate scheduling behaviors with [MathLab](https://github.com/bufferflies/tidb-simulink), which establishes control modeling for scheduling and can help to find optimization ideas.

His authored pull requests are listed [here](https://github.com/tikv/pd/pulls?q=+is%3Apr+author%3Abufferflies+).

I (@nolouch and @rleungx) hereby nominate @bufferflies as PD Committer and call for a vote.

## Result

Approved by 2 binding votes, 4 non-binding votes.

* nolouch (binding)
* rleungx (binding)
* JmPotato (non-binding)
